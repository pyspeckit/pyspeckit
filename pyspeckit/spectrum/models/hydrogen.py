Hydrogen Models
---------------

Hydrogen in HII regions is typically assumed to follow Case B recombination
theory.

The values for the Case B recombination coefficients are given by `Hummer &
Storey (1987)
<http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1987MNRAS.224..801H&db_key=AST>`_.
They are also computed in `Hummer (1994)
<http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994MNRAS.268..109H>`_ and tabulated at a `wiki
<http://wiki.hmet.net/index.php/HII_Case_B_Recombination_Coefficients>`_.  I
had to OCR and pull out by hand some of the coefficients.
